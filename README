this is the latest in a series of scratchpads for various procedural / gamedev
code explorations. the code is not particularly well-structured.

this is not currently buildable due to local dependencies. namely, the gpipe
packages (GPipe, GPipe-GLFW, and GPipe-TextureLoad) are outdated and will not
build with the current `base` package. my workaround for this was to turn off
upper bound limits, cabal fetch the packages, and alter them to build locally.
(the specific issue is that they're outdated with regards to the
semigroup/monoid proposal, and need their Monoid instances split into
Semigroup and Monoid instances. there are no other issues with gpipe.)
